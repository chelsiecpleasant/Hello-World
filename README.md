Hello, my name is Chelsie Pleasant. 
I am interested in baking, making mesh wreaths, dogs, and of course coding!
I am not currently learning anything. However, I am always eager to learn. 
You can reach me by either email or phone. My email is chelsie.c.pleasant and my phone number is (606) 309-0666.
My pronouns are she/her.
Fun Fact: I recently learned about the dog breed pitbulls and I love the breed despite the stigma that the breed has.
